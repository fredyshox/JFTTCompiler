## TODO list

Features:
* keywords detection in lexer - trailing/leading spaces
* loop reset state at the end of body
* array support
* condition three address code: JUMP<op> operator
* label support

Array support:
* assign memory location to each symbol at the begining
* array memory: location bounds, initial position, location = initial + offset
* command produces array symbol - store it: read, assignment are only capable
